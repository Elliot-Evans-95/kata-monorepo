## About this Kata

> **_This is based on the [Theatrical Players](https://github.com/emilybache/Theatrical-Players-Refactoring-Kata) kata_**

Refactoring is usually driven by a need to make changes. 
There is code that currently prints the statement as HTML in addition to the existing plain text version. 
The current theatrical players want to add new kinds of plays to their repertoire, for example history and pastoral.

The Kata currently contains approval testing to rapidly test existing code.

## Tasks

We need to add more performances into the current performance types:

* Add the "henry-v" performance which is a type (history)
* Add the "as-like" performance which is a type (pastoral)

> **NOTE** - all code should be tested by the end of the kata (100% coverage)

## Before you start

This kata has the expectation that you will incrementally work on the tasks (one step at a time).
You have **2 hours** to work on this kata.
