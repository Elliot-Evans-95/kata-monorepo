## About this Kata

> **_This is based on the [String Calculator](https://codingdojo.org/kata/StringCalculator/) kata_**

This kata is about incremental adding logic to one function.

## Tasks

* Write a program that takes a string input and outputs a string
* Add to the method, so it can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers separated by comma, and return their sum
* Allow the `add` method to handle an unknown number of arguments.
* Allow the `add` method to handle newlines as separators so "1\n2,3" should return "6".
* Donâ€™t allow the input to end in a separator so "1,3," is invalid and should return an error message.
* Calling `add` with negative numbers will return the message "Negative not allowed : " listing all negative numbers that were in the list of numbers.
* Calling `add` with multiple errors will return all error messages separated by newlines.
